Auto-config issues on Cloudera Manager Template



PROBLEM STATEMENT

The customer is having issues when deploying the 2 solr services via a cluster template.

We would like to know How does auto-config know which one is which when you have different Solr services?

On the customer test it seems to pick the first one encountered in the template, but then it also changes the name of the second one to have a seemingly random numerical suffix.

SUPPORT ANALYSIS

This issue is related with ENGESC-3617. The Solr engineering team has discarted an issue from the Solr side, it seems more a template Integration/parsing issue on Cloudera Manager.

EXPECTED ENGINEERING ACTION

This is a completely new problem and we need Cloudera Manager engineering help as we don't know the internals of the auto-config and the template import.
